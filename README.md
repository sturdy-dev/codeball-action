# CODEBALL &mdash; AI CODE REVIEW üîÆ

Codeball is a code review AI which approves Pull Requests that a human would have approved. Spend less time waiting, save time and money.

The AI identifies and approves safe contributions, so that you get to focus your energy on the tricky ones.

## GitHub Action

The Codeball GitHub Action runs [Codeball](https://codeball.ai/) on all new Pull Requests, and approves the Pull Request ([example](https://github.com/sturdy-dev/codeball-action/pull/7)) if the model classifies it as safe.

- [Online Demo](https://codeball.ai/)
- [How Codeball Works](https://codeball.ai/how)

## Quick Start

1. Create a new file called `.github/workflows/codeball.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Codeball
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  codeball_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Codeball
    steps:
      - name: Codeball
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action@v2
```

2. üéâ That's it! Codeball will now run on new Pull Requests, and will approve the PR if it's a good one!

## Customizations

Codeball Actions are built on multiple smaller building-blocks, that are heavily configurable through GitHub Actions.

### Example: "Dry-run" mode, labels all PRs with the Codeball Result

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è codeball-dry-run.yml</summary>
  
```yaml
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  codeball:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Codeball
    steps:

      # Start a new Codeball review job
      # This step is asynchronous and will return a job id
      - name: Trigger Codeball
        id: codeball_baller
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/baller@v2


      # Wait for Codeball to return the status
      - name: Get Status
        id: codeball_status
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/status@v2
        with:
          codeball-job-id: ${{ steps.codeball_baller.outputs.codeball-job-id }}

      # If Codeball approved the contribution, add a "codeball:approved" label
      - name: Label Approved
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/labeler@v2
        if: ${{ steps.codeball_status.outputs.approved == 'true' }}
        with:
          name: "codeball:approved"
          color: "86efac" # green

      # If Codeball did not approve the contribution, add a "codeball:needs-review" label
      - name: Label Needs Review
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/labeler@v2
        if: ${{ steps.codeball_status.outputs.approved == 'false' }}
        with:
          name: "codeball:needs-review"
          color: "bfdbfe" # blue

```
</details>

### Example: Approve only (no labels)

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è codeball-approve.yml</summary>
  
```yaml
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  codeball:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Codeball
    steps:

      # Start a new Codeball review job
      # This step is asynchronous and will return a job id
      - name: Trigger Codeball
        id: codeball_baller
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/baller@v2


      # Wait for Codeball to return the status
      - name: Get Status
        id: codeball_status
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/status@v2
        with:
          codeball-job-id: ${{ steps.codeball_baller.outputs.codeball-job-id }}

      # If Codeball approved the contribution, approve the PR
      - name: Approve PR
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/approver@v2
        if: ${{ steps.codeball_status.outputs.approved == 'true' }}
        with:
          message: "Codeball: LGTM! :+1:"
```
</details>


### Example: Filter files (run only for PRs modifying a single service)

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è codeball-filter-files.yml</summary>
  
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    # Run Codeball only if files under "/web/" has been modified (and no other files)
    # See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-and-excluding-paths
    paths:
      - '!**'
      - '/web/**'

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  codeball:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Codeball

    steps:

      # Start a new Codeball review job
      # This step is asynchronous and will return a job id
      - name: Trigger Codeball
        id: codeball_baller
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/baller@v2


      # Wait for Codeball to return the status
      - name: Get Status
        id: codeball_status
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/status@v2
        with:
          codeball-job-id: ${{ steps.codeball_baller.outputs.codeball-job-id }}

      # If Codeball approved the contribution, approve the PR
      - name: Approve PR
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/approver@v2
        if: ${{ steps.codeball_status.outputs.approved == 'true' }}
        with:
          message: "Codeball: LGTM! :+1:"
```
</details>


### Example:

<details>
  <summary>‚ñ∂Ô∏è codeball-fail-not-approved.yml</summary>

```yaml
on: [pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  codeball:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Codeball
    steps:
      # Start a new Codeball review job
      # This step is asynchronous and will return a job id
      - name: Trigger Codeball
        id: codeball_baller
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/baller@v2

      # Wait for Codeball to return the status
      - name: Get Status
        id: codeball_status
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/status@v2
        with:
          codeball-job-id: ${{ steps.codeball_baller.outputs.codeball-job-id }}

      # If Codeball approved the contribution, approve the PR
      - name: Approve PR
        uses: sturdy-dev/codeball-action/approver@v2
        if: ${{ steps.codeball_status.outputs.approved == 'true' }}
        with:
          message: 'Codeball: LGTM! :+1:'

      # If Codeball didn't approve the contribution, fail the job.
      - name: Fail Job
        if: ${{ steps.codeball_status.outputs.approved == 'fail' }}
        run: |
          echo "Not approved"
          exit 1
```

## Building Blocks

The Codeball sub-actions are:

* [`sturdy-dev/codeball-action/baller/@v2`](./baller/README.md) ‚Äì Triggers new Codeball Jobs
* [`sturdy-dev/codeball-action/status/@v2`](./status/README.md) ‚Äì Waits for the the Codeball result
* [`sturdy-dev/codeball-action/approver/@v2`](./approver/README.md) ‚Äì¬†Approves PRs
* [`sturdy-dev/codeball-action/labeler/@v2`](./labeler/README.md) ‚Äì Adds labels to PRs

## How Codeball works

Codeball uses a deep learning model that has been trained on over 1 million Pull Requests. For each contribution it considers in hundreds of inputs, including:

- The code diffs (perceptual hashes)
- The author's recent experience with the affected files
- The change frequency of the affected files
- Past code reversals / fix-ups

Codeball is optimized for precision, which means it only approves contributions that it's really confident in.

## Troubleshooting

### Permissions

Codeball works out of the box with GitHub Actions. 

If you're using non-default permissions, or want to use a custom access token. Make sure that you're running Codeball with the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  issues: write
  pull-requests: write
```

### Forks and private repositories

By default, only pull requests from a fork does not have "write" permissions when running in GitHub Actions, and those Pull Requests can not be approved.

If you're using forks from a private repository, and want to use Codeball on Pull Requests created from a fork.  Enable "Send write tokens to workflows from fork pull requests" on the repository ([docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks)).
